# Hi 👋, I'm Ahsan Baidar Bakht

### 🚀 About Me
I’m a passionate Computer Vision researcher focused on **multimodal visual tracking**, **underwater image enhancement**, and **vision-language-action (VLA) models** for robotics. Currently pursuing a PhD where I develop datasets and algorithms to push the boundaries of embodied AI and maritime perception.

### 🔭 Current Work
- Developing the **MVTD** (Maritime Visual Tracking Dataset) featuring 5 modalities for advanced object tracking research
- Designing **GAN-based models** for underwater image dehazing and enhancement
- Exploring integration of vision and language for mobile robot navigation

### 🛠️ Skills & Tools
Python | PyTorch | Deep Learning | GANs | Computer Vision | Dataset Curation | Robotics | Vision-Language Models
